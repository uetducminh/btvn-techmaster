    <h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <p>
      Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of
      Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year. I will
      answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
    </p>
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
    <p>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time,
      however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a
      semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
      <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
      <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would
      prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can find more information about
      <a href="https://example.com/">important university dates</a> on our
      website.
    </p>
    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    <p>
      At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research
      facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science
      and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and
      just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the
      ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of
      priority:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Turning Hy0 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol
        (C14H1203.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures
        exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the audience size exponentially increases
        (effect of 3 x 103 increasing to 3 x 104)
      </li>
      <li>
        <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and
        <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for
        representing musical scores.
      </li>
    </ol>
